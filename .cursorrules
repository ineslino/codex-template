# Cursor AI Instructions

**Read these files in order:**

3. This file – Cursor-specific additions

## Cursor-Specific Context

This file is automatically loaded by Cursor when working in this repository.

### What Cursor provides

- Multi-file editing with AI assistance
- Code completion and suggestions
- Terminal command generation
- Codebase-aware chat

### Cursor workflow integration

When working with Cursor:
- Use Cmd/Ctrl+K for inline code generation
- Use Cmd/Ctrl+L for chat
- Follow the documentation-first workflow defined in AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md
- Update session_summary.md before ending each session

### Migration note

This is the legacy `.cursorrules` file. Cursor is moving to `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` files.
For new projects, consider migrating to the new format.

## Template-Specific Notes

This is a **template repository**.

When using this template for a real project:
1. Keep AGENTS.md and AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md as-is (or adapt minimally)
2. Replace `docs/project_context.md` with actual project description
3. Populate `docs/progress.md` with real work items
4. Create `docs/feature_specs/` for detailed requirements
5. Update `session_summary.md` after each work session

## Priority Reminder

If any content in this file conflicts with:
- **AGENTS.md** → AGENTS.md wins
- **AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md** → AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md wins

This file only adds Cursor-specific context, it does not override universal rules.
